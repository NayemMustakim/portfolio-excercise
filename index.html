    <p>I am a Mern Stack web developer.I have been working as a full stack developer since 2021. Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web development in university, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design front-end and server side to back-end. As a result, being both web designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
